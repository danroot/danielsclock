# Agent Context for Daniel's Clock Project

## Project Overview
This is Daniel's Clock, a simple web application that displays an analog clock showing Central Time (CT) along with current weather information for Madison, Mississippi.  It is for display on a 800x480 pixel e-ink screen. Content should be black and white only and optimized for readability on an e-ink display.
